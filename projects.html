          <h1>Smoking Cessation App</h1>
          <p>
            Smoking Cessation is an Android app that helps people quit smoking using
            Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and "just in time" prevention. User downloads
            the app when they are still smoking regularly. They notify the app whenever they
            smoke, and the app saves the time and location of this smoke break.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the user indicates that they are starting quitting, all of their smoke breaks
            are analyzed by a web service using some fancy schmancy machine learning to
            determine when and where they are most likely to smoke. When they are in that place
            at that time, the app will send a notification with some sort of positive
            reinforcement to stay clean.
          </p>
          <p>
            That app is written in Java (naturally). Database used is SQLite, with ActiveAndroid
            as the ORM technology. Web service has yet to be designed or implemented, so that's
            still up in the air.

          <h1>My Little Bartender</h1>
          <p>
            This is a webapp that is designed to help people find cocktails based on the
            ingredients that they have and/or feel like using. It takes in a list of
            and outputs a list of recipes that have those ingredients along with additional
            parameters (e.g. must have a certain ingredient, or can/cannot include cocktails
            with ingredients not included in the search query).
          </p>
          <p>
            Backend uses Python's Flask framework. The frontend uses jQuery and Bootstrap. This
            is currently still being developed, and My Little Bartender is only a working
            title, as I can't think of any better names that are free. If you have any clever
            puns to use, please let me know. Unfortunately, Cocktail Snob and Mix Master are
            taken.
