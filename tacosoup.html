"I just throw stuff in without measuring anything. Here goes: ingredients; cooked chicken breast - cubed, uncooked rice, canned chilies, canned corn, cut up tomatos, and taco seasonings. No measuring. If you like a lot of one ingredient than put as much as you like. Fill a large pot with water, throw in about half to one cup of wice with all ingredients except chicken. Put in enough taco seasoning to taste. Soft boil until the rice is cooked and then throw in the chicken. Let sit for a day or so to really get good. Then top with chredded cheese, crushed Totilla chips and sour cream if you want." -Brenda Deeney, master chef
