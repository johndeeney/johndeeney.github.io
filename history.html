      <h2>Began working for Amplify Education</h2>
      <h3 class="date">2016 June 27</h3>
      <h3>Brooklyn, New York</h3>
      <p>
        For the first year, I helped maintain a webapp and systems behind it (Python
        Pyramid, Oracle DB, hosted on CentOS via AWS) to store and process student test
        information into lesson plans for teachers with students struggling with literacy.
        In 2016, I was moved to a team to develop infrastructure for supporting multiple
        educational web games.

        Here I worked and developed an internal dashboard drawing and aggregating data from
        various services. Backend used Flask for Python. Got experience with frontend
        development using jQuery and Bootstrap. Was a great experience with great people.

      <h3 class="date">2014 August, 2015 January</h3>
      <h3>Beaverton, Oregon</h3>
      <p>
        This time around, I ended up working on their internal web tools used for tracking
        equipment. Frontend was using vanilla JavaScript (no jQuery, and it was originally
        written in 2006) and HTML. The backend was made with PHP that the original author
        seemed to use a random number generator to determine how many tabs each line should
        use. It was a test in patience and a good experience in dealing with legacy code from
        Hell.

      <h3>St. Petersburg, Florida</h3>
      <p>
        I developed software for various military aircraft. Much of this used embedded C.
        I helped develop a test touch-screen MCDU. Worked on bug fixes for [CLASSIFIED]'s MCDU. 
        The only project I was given much freedom on was developing Perl scripts that
        ended up cutting overall build time down by ~4 hours, which was done every week. This
        was where I learned that I don't want to work in a huge cubicle farm in a giant
        bureaucracy.

        Here I worked as an QA tester. Mostly worked as a black box tester. It was a very good
        experience to see how start-ups operate. It underwent acquisition by Incomm while I was
        there, so their name was changed to Incomm Digital Solutions, which can make my
        resume confusing at times.
